# Vidrio translations

The Vidrio app is internationalized.
The text in the app comes from the `*.lproj/Localizable.strings` files in this repository.
To port Vidrio to your language, 
[email Jim](mailto:jameshfisher@gmail.com),
or follow the instructions below ...

## How to port the translations

* Find your [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), e.g. French is `fr`
* Create a file for this language code, e.g. `fr.lproj/Localizable.strings`
* Copy the English content from `en.lproj/Localizable.strings`
* Translate the text on the right-hand side of the `=`, e.g. `"Resume" = "Reprendre";`
* Note `%@` is a format string; it represents a word that will be added later
